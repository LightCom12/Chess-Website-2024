            At ChessGurus, we believe the impact of chess goes far beyond the board. We’ve seen how it helps students develop focus, patience, and problem-solving skills — all while having fun and building confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
            We’re proud to bring our teaching into schools like Ryan Elementary, where we introduce young minds to the power of strategic thinking through engaging lessons and playful competition. Watching students grow, not just in skill, but in mindset, is at the heart of what we do.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether it’s guiding a beginner through their first checkmate or helping a player sharpen their strategy, we’re here to support meaningful growth, one move at a time.
